# About the Constructicon

The Russian Constructicon (RusCnn) is a free open-access electronic resource
that offers a searchable database of multiword grammatical constructions of
Russian. With over 2200 constructions (and more being continuously added), the
Russian Constructicon is arguably the largest openly available constructicon
resource for any language. The constructions are accompanied with thorough
descriptions of their properties and illustrated with corpus-based example
sentences. Descriptions are provided by linguists and translated into English
and Norwegian. The constructions are organized in families, clusters, and
networks based on their semantic and syntactic properties. Search functions
make it possible to filter constructions for a variety of features including
semantic types, syntactic patterns, stylistic flavor, morphological categories,
semantic roles, and CEFR levels of language proficiency. 

The resource is designed for both researchers and L2 learners of Russian and
strategically targets highly frequent but non-transparent constructions that
are most essential for learners of Russian. We focus on those language specific
constructions that have both “fixed” lexical elements and open slots. A good
example is the construction *net-net da i VP-Pfv* (lit. ‘no-no and do X’) used
for referring to irregular events, as in *On net-net da i sprosit* ‘He can
occasionally ask a question’. Other peculiar constructions collected in this
resource include *(na NP-Acc) ne napaseš’sja (NP-Gen)*, as in *Na vsex ne
napaseš’sja* (‘One cannot prepare enough resources for everyone’), *NP-Nom Cop
tak sebe*, as in *Kartina byla tak sebe* (‘The painting was so-so [lit. that
self]’), *xoroš VP-Ipfv.Inf!*, as in *Xoroš prygat’!* (‘Stop jumping! [lit. good
jump]’), etc. Many such constructions are more frequent than fully idiomatic
expressions and present L2 learners with a greater challenge: they are
ubiquitous in spoken and written language but often underrepresented in
descriptive grammars of Russian.

The Russian Constructicon is a joint project administered as a collaboration
between UiT The Arctic University of Norway (CLEAR research group) in Tromsø
and the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow
(School of Linguistics). Both faculty and students at all levels (BA through
PhD) contributed to the project. Building the Russian Constructicon was funded
by SIU project “Constructing a Russian Constructicon” (NCM-RU-2016/10025) in
2016 and the TWIRLL project (“Targeting Wordforms in Russian Language
Learning”, CPRU-2017/10027) in 2017-2020 supported by Norwegian Agency for
International Cooperation and Quality Enhancement in Higher Education (Diku,
<https://diku.no/en>).
